## 🤖 Introvert BOT - Obstacle Avoiding & Voice Controlled Robot

### 🔍 Overview

**Introvert BOT** is an autonomous robotic vehicle designed to **detect and avoid obstacles** using an ultrasonic sensor and **respond to Bluetooth and voice commands**. Built on the **Arduino UNO** platform with the **Adafruit Motor Shield**, this project explores the integration of sensors, actuators, and wireless communication to create a versatile and intelligent robotic system.

The robot not only avoids obstacles with precision using a **servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor**, but also provides **visual (RGB LED)** and **auditory (buzzer)** feedback based on its environment and actions. With Bluetooth integration, it can also be **remotely controlled using voice commands** from a mobile device.
